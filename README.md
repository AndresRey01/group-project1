# Marvel Search Engine

## Description
 We Have created a Marvel based search engine that allows users to type in any Marvel character onto the search bar for a small description of the character!

The app saves searches that the user has done upon refresh and they are able to click on one of the past searches to immediately go to character they had seen. There is also a small clock on the top left of the page which is based on the current users time zone! The clock should automatically update every second to keep you updated on the time.

## Technologies

The API's used for this website were the Marvel api which allows you to search for any characater in the Marvel database, and a Clock api which retrieves updates on the time for the user!
